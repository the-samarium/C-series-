# C Series

This repository contains C programs and examples for learning and practice.  
The goal is to build a collection of simple to intermediate C programs covering:

- Basics of C syntax and structure
- Functions and modular programming
- Pointers and memory management
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)
- File handling
- Small projects (such as a cricket scoreboard, file compression using RLE, etc.)
